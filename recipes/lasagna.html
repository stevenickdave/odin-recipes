    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> <p>First, make the white sauce. Put the milk, onion and bay leaves into a large saucepan abd bring very gently just up to the boil. Turn off the head and set aside for 1 hour to infuse</p> </li>
        <li> <p>For the meat sauce, put the oil, celery, onion, garlic and pancetta in a large sauce pan. Gently cook together until the veg is soft but not coloured.  </p></li>    
        <li> <p>Tip in the beef mince, the milk and chopped tomatoes. Using a wooden spoon, stir together and break up and mash the lumps of mince against the side of the pan. When the mince is mostly broken down, sitr in all the herbs, stock cubes and red wine, bringing it to a simmer.</p></li>
        <li><p>Uncover and gently simmer for another 30 mins to 1 hour until the meat is tender and saucy. Taste and season.</p></li>
        <li><p>To finish the white sauce, strain the milk through a fine sieve into one or two jugs. Melt the butter in the same pan, then using a wooden spoon, mix the flour and cook for 2 mins.</p></li>
        <li><p>Stir in the strained milk, a little at a time - the mix will thicken at first to a doughy paste, but keep going, gradually adding milk to avoid lumps. Bring to a gentle simmer, sitrring constantly. Genttle bubble for a mins until thickened. Season with salt and pepper</p></li>
        <li><p>Heat the oven to 180C, Spread a spoonful of the meat sauce over the base of a baking dish. Cover with a single layer of dried pasta sheets, snapping them to fit if needed, then top with a quarter of the white sauce. Spoon over a third of the meat sauce and scatter parmesan over the top.</p></li>
        <li><p>Repeat the layers - pasta, white sauce, meat and parmesan - two more times to use all the meat sauce. Add a final layer of pasta, the last of the white sauce and remaining cheese. Sit the dish on a baking tray and bake for 1 hour untill bubbling, browned and crisp on top. </p></li>
